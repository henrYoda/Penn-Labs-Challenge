# Penn-Labs-Challenge
Submission for the Penn Labs technical challenge, consisting of an iOS app made with SwiftUI to display the Penn dining options.

## Introduction
Welcome! This is my submission for the Penn Labs technical challenge. For this project, I chose to use the brand new SwiftUI user interface toolkit. This was my first contact with SwiftUI and it wasn't easy to learn (the syntax is very, very weird), but I thought that it would be a fun challenge!
